# Recycle

An interactive fiction project made with [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink).

## Prerequisites

Download [inklecate](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases).

## Run

```
inklecate -p ./story/main.ink
```

## Build

```
inklecate ./story/main.ink
```

This generates a `.ink.json` file that can be used with [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) to create a playable web version of the project.
